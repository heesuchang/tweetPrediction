    "# CSCI 4622 - Spring 2018 - Practicum \n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This practicum is due on Moodle by **11:59pm on Thursday May 3rd**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Here are the rules:** \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Your work must be done entirely on your own. You may **NOT** collaborate with classmates or anyone else.  \n",
    "3. You may **NOT** post to message boards or other online resources asking for help. \n",
    "5. You may **NOT** use late days on the practicum nor can you drop your practicum grade. \n",
    "1. You may use your course notes, posted lecture slides, in-class notebooks, and homework solutions as resources. \n",
    "2. You may consult alternate sources like blog posts or technical papers, but you may **NOT** copy code from these sources. \n",
    "3. Any additional non-course sources that you use should be clearly cited (with links) in the **References** section at the bottom of this notebook. \n",
    "7. Submit only this Jupyter notebook to Moodle.  Do not compress it using tar, rar, zip, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Violation of the above rules will result in an **F** in the course and a trip to **Honor Council** \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**By writing your name below you agree to abide by the given rules:**\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTES**: \n",
    "\n",
    "- You do not need to implement everything from scratch.  At this point you should be leveraging Sklearn as much as you can. \n",
    "- If you have a clarifying question, please post it as a **PRIVATE** message to me on Piazza. \n",
    "- Part of the goal of this assignment is to see if you can stand on your own.  Please do not ask me to help you debug code or check if your answers are correct. Most of the implementation details necessary to complete this practicum can be found in the Hands-On notebooks or the Sklearn documentation.  \n",
    "- You'll notice that the point totals below do not add up to 100.  This is because 10 out of the 100 points will be attributed to **style**.  To earn full credit for style your analysis should be concise and well-organized, your code should be readable and well-commented, and you should use plots and graphics to support your conclusions whenever appropriate.

    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "The classic MNIST Handwritten Digit data set has been a staple in the machine learning literature since the beginning of time (i.e. the late 90's).  However, machine learning practitioners have grown tired of the rusty digits and have recently begun to create and explore new, more interesting data sets. Some popular alternatives to emerge recently are [EMNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/emnist), [Sign Language MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist), and [Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist). In this problem you will explore the latter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fashion MNIST is comprised of $28 \\times 28$ pixel gray-scale images of clothing, with classes corresponding to things like tops, trousers, coats, dresses, and various types of shoes.  The data set that we'll work with corresponds to a small subset of Fashion MNIST with 1500 examples from each of five distinct classes (tops, trousers, coats, sneakers, and ankle boots). \n",

After that, the graph clearly indicates overfitting as we see a continuous decline. I didn't worry about the algorithm that queries the distances because it doesn't affect accuracy and only performance.

The graph above shows the accuracies I got for a few layers I tried for the 'lbfgs' solver. I chose my hidden layers based on studies that I found people talk about on Stack Overflow (Ref 1 under References).\n",

    "After experimenting with different alpha values (L2 regularization parameter), I found that 0.01 gives the highest accuracy 0.9638666666666668. However, this is still smaller than the accuracy 0.9663999999999999 I got without alphas. This difference is negatable however, since there is a little variability with cross validation. The conclusion we can reach is that the regularization won't help. The default value was probably the most ideal."

    "Next, I experimented with the 'adam' solver. With this solver, you can choose whether to enable early stopping, which determines when to stop based on validation of 10% of the data given or to disable early stopping altogether. I compared these two with the different layers I used for 'lbfgs'. And we can see that though early stopping works for some of the smaller layers, not early stopping helps for most of the later layers with more hidden layers. The best architecture was (527) of accuracy 0.9609333333333334 without early stopping. This architecture was found from a formula from Ref. 1. This surprised me because I thought early stopping would give better results. So far, this proves to be less accurate than 'lbfgs' but we still have learning rates and regularization to mess with."

    "In this problem you will again work with the Twitter election data from **Problem 2**, but this time in its unadulterated raw form. Unlike in **Problem 2**, you will only be allowed to use Logistic Regression as your classifier.  Instead of using a fancier model, you will attempt to improve performance by crafting better features.  One way you might do this is to explore text models that are more sophisticated that simple Bag-of-Words. Alternatively, you might explore the training data and identify characteristics of tweets by a particular author that you can then turn into a feature. \n",

    "The class `TweetFeaturizer` shown below is already fully functional.  Your goal in this problem is to make it better.  In it's current state, the class reads in the training and test data, fits a Logistic Regression model using Bag-of-Words, makes predictions on the test set, and then dumps the predictions to a csv file that can be uploaded to Kaggle. You are free to modify this class is any way that you see fit, but we've given you some helpful functionality that will prove sufficient for most of you.  The `add_text_features` method currently loops over each tweet in the data set, copies it to a new array, and then passes that array into the text vectorizer.  One way to create new features is to append distinct word-indicators onto the string representing the tweet.  These will then be turned into features by the vectorizer. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example (that is intentionally silly and probably unhelpful): Suppose you think a potentially helpful feature is whether or not the tweet contains more than 10 instances of the letter `z`.  In `add_text_features` you could count the number of `z`'s in a tweet and if there are more than 10, you could append the word `MoreThanTenZs` to the tweet.  Then, when the tweet is passed into the vectorizer, this will turn into a numerical feature.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to competing against yourself to craft the best features that you can, you'll also compete against your classmates in a Kaggle competition.  The competition page can be found here: \n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/c/4622-election-tweet-authorship\n",
    "\n",
    "A private invite link will be available on Piazza which will get you into the competition. Note that the test data has been partitioned into a public leaderboard set and a private leaderboard set.  While the competition is open, submitting to Kaggle will tell you your score on the public leaderboard.  Your scores on the private leaderboard will become available at the end of the competition.   The top **THREE** students on the **Private** leaderboard at the end of the competition will earn 10 extra credit points on the Practicum. Note that to prevent the machine learning-equivalent of button mashing, we've limited you to **10** submissions per day.  You should be evaluating your features locally with cross-validation and then submitting to Kaggle when you think you have something that works.  "

    "I remembered watching a video essay about the way Trump tweets (Ref. 2). In that essay, it mentions how Trump ends his tweets in exclamations. He swayed many voters with his strong emotional actions over political policy and logic so this made sense. I tested that out and it helped my accuracy jump a lot. I also knew that Trump would have used ALL CAPS as part of his strategy to convey his emotion in his tweets and I confirmed this in the training set. Clinton used a lot of website links in hers so I made this into a feature as well. I got rid of the link namespace (https: // ...) because I felt it would influence the logistic regression negatively with useless words and characters and substituted with a string that explained there was a link there. I left the end of the URL because Clinton would often link to the same website in her tweets. All these features ended up on the top 10's list for at least either candidate before I experimented with the analyzer for the Count Vectorizer so I feel that this is a good indication that these features work. \n",
